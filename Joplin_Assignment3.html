					I eat fruit for ever meal and stick with the same 3 on a majority of the days. <br> 
					I like eating Oragnes in the morning with a bagel and a glass of orange juice
					Then for lunch i usually eat and apple with a sandwhich and a bag of chips with water.<br>
					Then lastly i switch up what i eat for dinner every night but after i eat i like to have some type of berries tyipacaly blueberries or strawberries.
